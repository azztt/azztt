### Hello folks ðŸ‘‹, I am Anweshan Bor
As a driven and adaptable data science student passionate about technology and innovation, I am dedicated to leveraging my skills to tackle complex challenges and drive impactful solutions. With a foundation in data structures, algorithms, and machine learning, I thrive in dynamic environments where I can apply my expertise to make a difference.

Throughout my academic journey, I have pursued coursework in diverse areas such as Data Management and Retrieval, Optimization Algorithms, and Statistics for Data Science, complementing my hands-on experience in software engineering and development. My proficiency in languages including Python, and C++ and frameworks like ReactJS, and familiarity with cloud platforms such as Azure, AWS, and Google Cloud, equips me to contribute effectively to cutting-edge projects.

In my previous roles, including positions at Wells Fargo International Solutions Private Limited, I have demonstrated my ability to collaborate with multidisciplinary teams, deliver high-quality solutions, and adapt to evolving requirements. From enhancing internal applications to co-designing end-to-end customer sentiment analysis systems, I am committed to driving innovation and providing tangible results.

As I continue my academic journey and pursue advanced coursework in areas like Natural Language Processing and Data Mining, I am eager to explore new opportunities for growth and learning. I am passionate about leveraging technology to address real-world challenges and am excited about the possibility of contributing to forward-thinking organizations like yours.

I am open to new connections and opportunities for collaboration. Let's connect and explore how we can work together to drive innovation and positively impact the world of technology.

Currently I am looking for full-time Data Science/Quantitative research internships to gain experience in the are between May-Dec 2024
